  <header><h1> So you've heard about the Palgrave Macmillan £30 discount?
  </h1></header>

  <p> Palgrave Macmillan are offering £30 off any book until 31st December, even
  a book under £30. I got a book for free, no postage and packing, no card
  details. </p>

  <p> Even if you don't really want a book, you should get one anyway. Palgrave
  are part of Springer, a massive academic publisher who charge extortionate
  rates for accessing journals and buying books. In many cases, they even charge
  academics or institutions to publish in their journals &mdash; and then the
  institution's library has to pay for others to see it. This is a massive
  enclosure of knowledge. Take what you can from the bastards. If you don't want
  the book, donate it to a library. </p>

  <p> Merry Christmas. </p>

  <h2> Email addresses </h2>

  <p> After you've bought a book, you can log out/clear your cookies and buy
  another one (and another, etc.) if you use a different email address. If you
  have a Gmail address, it's super easy to create a new email address that goes
  to your normal inbox, just add a '+' and some random junk to the end of your
  username. </p>

  <p> So if your email is <code>joe.bloggs@gmail.com</code>, you can sign up
  with <code>joe.bloggs+aardvark@gmail.com</code> and it'll be a valid email
  address that goes to your inbox. As will
  <code>joe.bloggs+aardwolf@gmail.com</code>, and
  <code>joe.bloggs+badger@gmail.com</code>. </p>

  <h2> Searching for books under £30 </h2>

  <p> Annoyingly, the site's search function doesn't let you filter by price
  &mdash; I found myself trawling through hundreds of pages of books that I
  couldn't afford. </p>

  <p> So I made a bookmarklet. </p>

  <p> If you drag and drop this link, <a href="javascript:(function () {var
  prices = document.getElementsByClassName('price'); for (i = 0; i <
  prices.length; i++) { if (prices[i].innerHTML.slice(1) - 0 > 30) {
  prices[i].parentElement.parentElement.style.display = 'none'; } }})()">Less
  than £30</a>, to your bookmarks bar, then click it when you're on the search
  results page, it will hide any books that cost more than £30. </p>

  <p> You're welcome. </p>
